This is actually a complicated process in which python must import and structure all of the voices, bars, notes, etc. in a way that it can understand. Thankfully, music21 has a converter command that can do this for you. This time, instead of executing just one command, we are going to tell python to run two commands at once. Each command will be separated by a line break, created by pressing enter. Execute the following (pressing the Shift+Enter or Ctrl+Enter **after** typing **both** lines):\n",

    "    <music21.stream.Score 0x24e272dda90>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This means that music21 has stored your score in something called a stream, and that stream has a unique identifier (0x24e272dda90 in my case). A stream is simply a data structure, and in music21 it is spaced in time. So, each object has an offset that represents how many quarter notes it lies from the beginning. A stream can (and often does) contain other streams for scores, parts, and measures. If you want to see the structures and values in your stream, you will have to run a looping command in Python. This means that you run a command (or series of commands) over and over as long as a particular condition is met. For a loop in Python, you start with 'for' and then place a colon (:) after you have written the condition statement. The looped code is then placed on the next line and indented. To see your stream, use the following code:\n",
