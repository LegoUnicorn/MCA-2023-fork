1. <i>Identify a piece of music to download and edit</i>

I have chosen ["Fem smärre Tonbilder (i sammanhang)"](https://www.swedishmusicalheritage.com/composers/andree-elfrida/SMH-W1200-Fem_smarre_tonbilder_i_sammanhang_Five_smaller_tone_paintings/) by Elfrida Andrée.

2. <i>Download and convert PDF</i>

3. <i>Edit at least 10 bars in MuseScore</i>

4. Immediately, MuseScore did not like the file it had OMR-ed when it gave me a "corrupted file" error. Specifically, it said "Voice too long: Full score, measure 10, staff 1, voice 3. Fount 8/12. Expected 42/64".
