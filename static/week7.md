1. Create a second version of the MEI file

2. Render the revised metadata

    The metadata is presented in an unintelligable, raw format without any newlines or separation of any kind. The simplest way to format the data to be more readable is to clearly separate critical items by line and category of metadata heading. Names that are not in propely formatted responsibility statements are also not clearly marked as being who they are supposed to be (the composer is just a freestanding name without a label), which is something that needs fixing.
