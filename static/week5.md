1. Create a metadata schema by listing elements (or a subset of at least 5 elements).
    
    The group had a wide selection of music but the general gist of what metadata should be highlighted was fairly clear.


        1. Title: of the piece.

        2. Subtitle: of the piece (optional).

        3. Composer: Name of the compoers of the original work.

        4. Encoder: Name of the person/entity that encoded the work.

        5. Date: Date the file was encoded.

        6. Orig_date: Date the work was originally created (with an "unknown" tag for cases when the provenance is unknown.)

        7. Key: of the work.

        8. Instrument(s): the work is played on.

2. Modify your MEI document to the schema.

    I have left the encoder declaration anonymized because I think that's what is the right thing for marking?
