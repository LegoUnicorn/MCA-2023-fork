# Task 1
Individual lab Week 10 `.ipynb` available [here](/notebooks/week10similarity_indlab.ipynb).

![all-note similarity analysis for week 10](/static/img/week_10_similarity.png)

Similarity analysis for all the tracks in week 10, having replaced the tracks 7-10 with the three from last week. The first four tracks are labelled as "classical", while the tracks 4-7 are "rock" What is evident is two main zones of the matrix, where the "classical" and "Swedish Musical Heritage" tracks are relatively similar to each other, while the rock music is only similar to the other rock tracks. 

This is consistent with the general C vs A occurence graph generated earlier in the notebook.

This is less of a discussion of "identifying the information that has been lost", and more of an "identifying the information that <b>hasn't</b> been lost".

The last 5 and a half measures are still evoking some feeling of the original piece in terms of pitch and musicality, but are still completely, unrecognizably wrong. The rest of the piece is so far removed from the original even when listening that I'm not even sure how much productive information can be gleamed. My initial thought is that the multiple voices of piano made the polyphonic transcription confused.
