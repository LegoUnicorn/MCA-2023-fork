Here it is!

2. <i>Identity a theme for your dataset.</i><br>

I scanned through the provided archives in the "Reading Lists" page, and ended up finding a repository for "lesser known" Swedish classsical music.<br>

[Swedish Musical Heritage(in English)](https://www.swedishmusicalheritage.com/) is a project run by the Swedish Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and intends to provide: 
>- A database containing comprehensive musical information about the composers and their music<br>
>- Critical editions of music scores which will be available for free on a website <br>
>- Authoritative texts about Swedish music history<br>
>- Radio recordings<br>
>~ <i>Swedish Musical Heritage website</i>
>
I believe that the dataset will include all three typoes of data.
